# Learning Strudel

This repository documents my progress learning **Strudel**, a live-coding environment for making music in JavaScript.  
Each file in this repo contains a short Strudel sketch — simple melodies, rhythm experiments, or sound design tests.

## How to run
1. Go to [https://strudel.tidalcycles.org](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org)
2. Copy the code from any `.js` file in this repository
3. Paste it into the Strudel editor and press **Run**

## Notes
I'm exploring how Strudel handles patterns, timing, and transformations.  
The goal is to gradually build musical complexity while understanding how the system works.
